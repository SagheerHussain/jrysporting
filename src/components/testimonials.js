      "Where do I start? My girlfriend & I are complete shotgun novices. We arrived (following a ringing endorsement from a friend) and Irene took us under her wing. What an amazing person, a credit to her profession. She walked us through the different type of guns, ammunition, how to carry everything correctly. She was patient, personable and just good fun. Not only would I recommend her and this place to anyone to try, I already have! We'll be back! PS: training coordinator Ron is another funny & amazing guy. Organizing this from the very off was a breeze and so much fun...before we even got to the course!!",

      "This place is awesome. It's in a private valley and is very beautiful. These setups for each shoot we're great. Prices are reasonable. The family and our friends had a blast. Just make sure to get there early. After 11am on the weekends it gets busy and you may have to wait at the stands. We got there before 9 and had no waiting before 11.",

      "What a hidden playground. Yes this place is so much fun. Driving in golf carts shooting guns! It is like golf going hole to hole only you shoot with a shotgun. Each station on the main course is different. There are traditional trap and skeet as well. A variety of areas to test your skills. You can rent guns, get snacks and drinks there even beer. So go and enjoy a day outdoors blasting away. Bring a camera as well great sights to photograph.",

      "We went as a family as first timers and had a great time. The staff are friendly and the atmosphere relaxed. I'm sure they have plenty of good instructors but I can not emphasize enough how our particular instructor influenced our experience. She is personable, knowledgeable, patient and expert at spotting our mistakes. Missed a target? Irene had spotted the problem before I had pulled the trigger . Some gentle advice and a little adjustment and 'Blam'! Little bits of clay filled the sky. Whether you are a novice or experienced you'll be a better shot by the end of the session. Definitely, without a doubt, 100% - ask for Irene!",

      "Came here as a work trip and was my first time shooting. I was pleasantly surprised by the grounds and the equipment on the property. The staff was kind and helpful. The whole operation seemed to be very professionally run, and it was a world away from the hustle of the Bay Area. We had an instructor who was patient and calm, and who helped us learn to shoot and navigate the course. All in all, I'll definitely consider coming back if I have the urge to do some shooting again in the future.",
